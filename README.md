# CRW model

## Simulations of tuna trajectories in a FAD array

Launch config files to launch the model (example of file in cfg folder). It will be launched using MAIN.py

To plot tuna trajectories: run simulation, when it is done running, run PLOT_tuna_traj.py, with r = number of the tuna of interest.

## Developments

future:
	several tunas at the same time (change class TUNA to TUNAS)
	add condition at the edge of square FAD array simualtions
