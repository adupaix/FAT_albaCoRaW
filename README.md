# CRW model

## Simulations of tuna trajectories in a FAD array

Launch config files to launch the model (example of file in cfg folder). It will be launched using MAIN.py

If you want to launch the model directly without using config files, use MAIN_no_cfg.py

## Developments

done:
	adding CRTs when reaching a FAD

future:
	several tunas at the same time (change class Tuna to TunaS)
