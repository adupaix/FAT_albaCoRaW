Individual based model simulating tuna trajectories in an array of Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), based on a Correlated Random Walk. This is the version of the model that was used to generate the results in the following publication:

PÃ©rez G., Dupaix A., Dagorn L., Deneubourg J-L., Holland K., Beeharry S., Capello M. (in press). Correlated Random Walk of tuna in Fish Aggregating Device arrays: field-based model from acoustic tagging. __Ecological Modelling__

# Run

The model runs with [Python 3.8.5](https://docs.python.org/release/3.8.5/)

The [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/) environment to run the model is provided. To create, type : `conda env create -f env_CRW-model.yml`

To run the model, type:

`python cfg/ex_cgf.py` where `ex_cfg.py` is the configuration file (template available in the `cfg` folder)

# Plot

To plot tuna trajectories: run simulation in a Python environment. Then run `PLOT_tuna_traj.py`, with r the id of the tuna of interest.
